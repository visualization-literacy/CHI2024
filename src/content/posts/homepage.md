## Introduction

We are proud to announce the first Workshop on Visualization Literacy to be held as part of ACM CHI 2024. The goal of this workshop is to:
> We aim to continue but not be constrained by these previous discussions. Starting with these seed questions as discussion
points, we will use the workshop to brainstorm additional topics, form actionable agendas for research, and serve as a
platform to foster collaborations.

Researchers have proposed many definitions of visualization literacy, targeting various aspects of the term. But we have yet to fully capture what it really means to be literate in visualizations, which has important downstream implications, such as how to effectively teach visualization skills to younger generations. We ran a meetup at IEEE VIS 2022 that attracted over 30 researchers in the field, who discussed aspects of visualization literacy such as how we measure it, how we can improve it, how it develops, and how it relates to other literacies. ACM CHI has a track record of attracting researchers from various fields such as visualization, learning sciences, and design, advancing research through both quantitative and qualitative approaches in and around HCI. For this year’s CHI, we propose to run a one-day workshop with the goal of further developing actionable research agendas to more comprehensively define, understand, and improve visualization literacy. By continuing critical discussions with diverse perspectives from the CHI community, we can deepen investigations of visualization literacy through multiple lenses, such as measurement, interventions, and pedagogy.

## Call for Paper
**Please use [this](https://forms.gle/URKJaYTLZbwEGRSZA) form to submit your work to the CHI 2024 Workshop: Toward a More Comprehensive Understanding of Visualization Literacy.**

Submissions should be 2-4 pages (excluding references), in single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template, comply with CHI 2024 paper accessibility guidelines, and do not need to be anonymized.

We welcome submissions targeting questions including, but not limited to:
- What is "visualization literacy'"?
- How can we more effectively measure visualization literacy?
- How can we design and develop interventions to reach a broader audience?
- How can we improve the teaching of visualizations?

**Position papers are strongly encouraged.** We aim for a workshop with lively discussion to help us move the field forward. Thus, we also accept **early stage or in-progress work**, which might benefit from discussion and feedback. We are less interested in ossified, finished work that would not benefit from (or contribute to) discussion. If you are uncertain if your work would fit, please reach out!

**Submissions are due by February 22, 2024 (AoE)**, notification of results will be by the middle of March (more details to come once we've received your submission), and accepted papers will be published on the Open Science Framework (OSF) open-access repository and on our workshop's [website](https://visualization-literacy.github.io/CHI2024/).

At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the in-person workshop and register for the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. Outputs from the workshop, including panel discussions, group activities, a summary workshop report, and accepted workshop submissions will be made available to the public on our workshop website, facilitating further discussions within and beyond the CHI community.

We look forward to your contributions!

Sincerely,
Organizers of the CHI24 Workshop on Visualization Literacy
