## Introduction
**This workshop aims to facilitate and deepen critical discussions about how to define, study, and improve visualization literacy.** 
By continuing critical discussions with diverse perspectives from the CHI community, we can deepen investigations of visualization literacy through multiple lenses, such as measurement, interventions, and pedagogy. Our specific aims are:

- Serve as a platform for researchers, teachers, and students to **share experiences of measuring visualization literacy** skills, practices, and dispositions in classrooms, **identify challenges** in quantification, and **brainstorm** ways to improve measurement in practice.
- **Develop and prototype** intervention ideas during group activities.
- Surface teachers' and researchers' existing knowledge to **reassess current teaching practices**, **identify areas for improvement** that align with visualization literacy, and **brainstorm classroom instructional strategies** targeting learners at different stages.
- **Redefine visualization literacy** as informed by visualization usage in everyday life.
- Develop more **concrete research agendas** with existing and new collaborations targeting questions including:
  - How can we more effectively define and quantify visualization literacy?
  - How can we design and develop interventions that reach a broader audience?
  - How can we improve visualization pedagogy, both in terms of what skills to teach and how to teach them?
  - How can we draw from research findings in areas such as measurement, interventions, and pedagogy to support visualization literacy theory and practice?

## Call for Participation
**Please use [this](https://forms.gle/URKJaYTLZbwEGRSZA) form to submit your work to the CHI 2024 Workshop: Toward a More Comprehensive Understanding of Visualization Literacy.**

Submissions should be 2-8 pages (excluding references), in [single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template]( https://chi2024.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-publication-formats/ ), comply with [CHI 2024 paper accessibility guidelines](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/), and do not need to be anonymized.

We welcome submissions targeting questions including, but not limited to:
- What is "visualization literacy'"?
- How can we more effectively measure visualization literacy?
- How can we design and develop interventions to reach a broader audience?
- How can we improve the teaching of visualizations?

**Position papers are strongly encouraged.** We aim for a workshop with lively discussion to help us move the field forward. Thus, we also accept **early stage or in-progress work**, which might benefit from discussion and feedback. We are less interested in finished work unless you feel it would benefit from (and contribute to) broader discussion. If you are uncertain if your work would fit, please reach out! You can reach us via email: visualizationliteracy[at]gmail.com

**Submissions are due by March 07, 2024 (AoE)**, notification of results will be by the end of March (more details to come once we've received your submission), and accepted papers will be published on the Open Science Framework (OSF) open-access repository and on our workshop's [website](https://visualization-literacy.github.io/CHI2024/resources/).

At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the in-person workshop and register for the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. Outputs from the workshop, including panel discussions, group activities, a summary workshop report, and accepted workshop submissions will be made available to the public on our workshop website, facilitating further discussions within and beyond the CHI community.

We look forward to your contributions!

Sincerely,
Organizers of the CHI24 Workshop on Visualization Literacy
